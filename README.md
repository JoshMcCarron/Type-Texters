# Type-Texters

* Type Texters is a game I made for a school project in the tenth grade. 
* It was developed in Java using "ready to program java," and at the time of development it's purpose was to demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of simple concepts such as conditionals, loops, methods, and arrays.

* The last modifications to the code were done in June 2019.
* I am currently learning how to use Java Swing so that I can translate this project into more accessible code
